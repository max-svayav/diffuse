Diffuse is a graphical tool for merging and comparing text files.  Diffuse is
able to compare an arbitrary number of files side-by-side and gives users the
ability to manually adjust line-matching and directly edit files.  Diffuse can
also retrieve revisions of files from bazaar, CVS, darcs, git, mercurial,
monotone, and subversion repositories for comparison and merging.

Some key features of Diffuse:
- ability to compare and merge an arbitrary number of files side-by-side (n-way merges)
- line-matching can be manually corrected by the user
- ability to directly edit files
- syntax highlighting
- bazaar, CVS, darcs, git, mercurial, monotone, and subversion support
- support for UTF-8 encoded unicode
- unlimited undo
- easy keyboard navigation
