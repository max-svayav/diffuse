----

Diffuse is a graphical tool for merging and comparing text files.  Diffuse is
able to compare an arbitrary number of files side-by-side and gives users the
ability to manually adjust line matching and directly edit files.  Diffuse can
also retrieve revisions of files from Bazaar, CVS, Darcs, Git, Mercurial,
Monotone, Subversion, and SVK repositories for comparison and merging.

Some key features of Diffuse:
- ability to compare and merge an arbitrary number of files side-by-side (n-way merges)
- line matching can be manually corrected by the user
- ability to directly edit files
- syntax highlighting
- Bazaar, CVS, Darcs, Git, Mercurial, Monotone, Subversion, and SVK support
- support for UTF-8 encoded unicode
- unlimited undo
- easy keyboard navigation

Requirements:

- Python >= 2.4
- PyGTK >= 2.10

----

Diffuse is implemented entirely in Python and should run on any platform with
Python and PyGTK.  If you need to manually install PyGTK, please be aware its
dependencies should be installed prior to installing PyGTK.

Diffuse can be installed from source on most Linux distributions by simply
copying the files and directories in the 'src' directory to the root of the
host system.

If you wish to install Diffuse (or portions of Diffuse) to other locations, the
paths used to locate configuration files, icons, and help documentation in
'/etc/diffuserc' and '/usr/bin/diffuse' need to be modified.

Diffuse's help documentation is written in the DocBook format and can be easily
converted into other formats using XSLT stylesheets.  If the local help
documentation or its browser are unavailable, Diffuse will attempt to display
the on-line help documentation using a web browser.

Some platforms specific post-install steps may be required to index the
documentation and mime-type handling.  A sample RPM SPEC file is included with
the source for reference.
